# Address Classification Challenge Dataset

Here you can find two datasets you can use for our address classification challenge.

The files are in JSON lines format, each line of the file containing one JSON object.

The `addresses.jsonl` file contains pairs of `address` and corresponding `country`. Each `address` will always contain a `city` in its content.

The `cities.jsonl` file contains pairs of `city` and corresponding `country`.

The `country` value is in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code format.

All data used to create this dataset was collected by OpenAddresses (http://openaddresses.io).
